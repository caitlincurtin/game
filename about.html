        <h1>A Game</h1>
        <p>
            A game is a recreational activity with (a) guidline(s) and or objective/goal. 
            That's what a game is to me. 
        </p>
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I love games, all kinds of them. Board games, video games, physical games, some of my favorites are: 
        </p>
        <u1>
            <li>Clue</li>
            <li>Minecraft</li>
            <li>The Manipulation Game</li>
        </u1>
        <p>
            Those games have and always will be my favorite games (except for this one of course), but there's a specific reason why. 
            I like them not only because they're fun to play and I've made great memories while playing, but it's because of the kind of game they are. 
            I love problem solving and innovating and figuring out what I can do to be better, all three of those games let me do that. 
            Incase you were wondering, my gamer types are the following: 
        </p>
        <u1>
            <li>67% Killer</li>
            <li>40% Achiever</li>
            <li>27% Explorer</li>
        </u1>
        <p>
            Don't ask how that math works out...
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not playing games I'm with my two best friends doing normal teenage girl stuff, going on Pinterest, watching out favorite movies (we're 
            suckers for Disney), don't get me wrong, we play a LOT of games too. One of my favorite kinds of games are the games that go along with books, I love 
            reading and anything that goes along with it, especially themed games to go along with the books. Same with TV shows, movies, or real life things.
