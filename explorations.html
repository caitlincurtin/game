            Making a board game from scratch sounds pretty jarring, BUT, when it's broken down into steps its not that hard at all. Here's how my 
            team members and I went about making our own board game;
            </p>
            <h2>Step 1: Define Your Goal</h2>
            <p>
            Defining your game's goal is one of the most important parts of developing your board game. Figuring out who you are making your game for 
            will help you make rules and activities catered to those types of people. In our board game, we catered the gameplay to the Killers and the 
            Achievers. Our game was filled with ways to make sure that you would be the player to win as well as a tangible piece to determine the 
            winner. 
            </p>
            <h2>Step 2: Decide on a Theme</h2>
            <p>
            You want a cool looking game for a number of reasons, most importanly though, you want people to want to play your game, and making your game 
            visually appealing will help give people an extra nudge into wanting to play the game. This comes in the form of the physical board for the
            game itself, to the game pieces and collectables, to the exposition and design in the rule book. <br></br>
            </p>
            <p>
            In our board game, we made it medevil themed where the playesrs can choose for their pieces to be either knights or different weapons like 
            cannons. The players also "experience" different aspects of medevil times as a knight fighting a battle for their kingdom. 
            </p>
            <h2>Step 3: Creation</h2>
            <p>
            Creating the way to play is also one of the most important parts of making your own board game. this is where you woud decide on what the 
            players actually do during the game. <br></br>
            </p>
            <p>
            For us, that meant figuring out what players would havw to do to be able to move across the board (dice roll), and what kinds of tasks they
            would have to complete to attain the collectable pieces that in the end decide who wins the game (more dice rolling). 
            </p>
            <h2>Step 4: Rules</h2>
